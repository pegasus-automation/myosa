  This code is developed under the MYOSA (LearnTheEasyWay) initiative of MakeSense EduTech and Pegasus Automation.
  Code has been derived from internet sources and component datasheets.
  Existing readily-available libraries would have been used "AS IS" and modified for ease of learning purpose.
  
  Blink Demo
  Connection: Connect the "Controller" board from the MYOSA kit power it up.
  Working: Blue status LED on the Controller board starts blinking for every 1 second.

  Synopsis of "Controller" board
  MYOSA Platform consists of a centralized motherboard also known as Controller board. It is board designed of the ESP-Wroom32 module.
  ESP32 is a low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
  It also has lot many GPIO pins along with famous communication protocols like i2c, uart, spi, etc. which can be used for interfacing with sensors and other modules.
